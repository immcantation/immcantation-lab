# Immcantation

Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies now allow for
large-scale characterization of B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell
receptor (TCR) repertoires. The high germline and somatic diversity of
the adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) presents challenges
for biologically meaningful analysis - requiring the development of
specialized computational methods.

The [Immcantation](http://immcantation.org) framework provide a start-to-finish analytical
ecosystem for high-throughput AIRR-seq datasets. Beginning from raw
reads, Python and R packages are provided for pre-processing,
population structure determination, and repertoire analysis.
